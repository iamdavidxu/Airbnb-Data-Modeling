# Airbnb-Data-Modeling 
The project focuses on creating, modifying, and analyzing a relational database. 

Our group designed a relational database schema to store listings, reviews, neighborhoods, bookings, and revenue-related data. Normalize the database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.

Index frequently queried columns to enhance query performance, especially for queries related to recent orders, popular properties, available accommodations, and revenue generation.

We also considered potential questions the user may ask when accessing the database.
Then write queries to answer the proposed questions.



## The repo contains:
- *Project_Introduction.md*: A basic introduction to the project considering the business scenario, data security, time complexity, and other information.

- *ERD.md*: An Entity Relational Diagram that was created based on an example database using Miro.

- *Create_database.sql*: This file contains the code that creates the entity sets using psql.

- *Problem_solution.sql*: Answer potenial questions users may have using our databse.

- *Reflection.md*: Refleating on the process creating and analyzing the database.
