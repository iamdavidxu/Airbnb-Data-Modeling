## Reflection

Throughout the design and implementation of our database, we encountered various challenges that deepened our understanding of database management. One major hurdle was deciding on primary and foreign keys due to the vast number of attributes, leading to potential overlaps and inaccuracies. This necessitated repeated revisions to ensure data integrity. Additionally, the complexity of relationships between tables required careful consideration to avoid data duplication and maintain consistency across the database. In addition, breaking down the data to logical units and effectively sorting them has also been a challenge. Reducing data redundancy is crucial while implementing the schema which allows the users to access data fast and easily.

We also faced the challenge of creating synthetic data, as the datasets available from sources like Kaggle and Inside Airbnb were either too extensive or lacked the specific entities we needed. This process taught us the importance of carefully planning each table entry, especially when it involves foreign keys and table relationships, to avoid confusion with larger datasets. We learned that breaking down complex information into more manageable components, such as separating contact information into distinct fields (first name, last name, date of birth, email, phone number), enhances the database's clarity and usability.

Peer review was essential in refining our database, providing insights that helped us address redundancies and enhance structure for practical application. Feedback on expanding contact info details and rectifying the cardinality between Listings and Neighborhoods was particularly valuable. It highlighted the importance of accurately modeling real-world relationships within our database, ensuring each listing is appropriately linked to a single neighborhood, thereby eliminating logical inconsistencies. This process was instrumental in developing a database that not only adheres to theoretical standards but is also pragmatically effective.

Implementing the database brought many challenges, especially in translating the theoretical schema into actual practical SQL commands. Writing efficient SQL code to create the tables, defining relationships between the tables, and setting constraints was a challenge. 

Reflecting on the entire process, several processes stand out to me. Firstly, the importance of planning in advance. Planning a well thought out design like the ERD diagram saves countless hours and ensures we can execute our project. Secondly, understanding how to apply real-world scenarios with our data was crucial for data integrity and performance. Lastly, understanding the intuitive nature of database management and design has taught me data-based decision making for strategic planning.
