Business Scenario: Our project revolves around the hospitality industry, with Airbnb as our primary focus. 
To access up-to-date data, we will use "Inside Airbnb", a platform that provides datasets such as 
"listings.csv," "reviews.csv," and "neighborhoods.csv” cover a range of 108 cities across 5 continents. 
This broad geographical coverage enables us to explore diverse housing markets and compare the number of Airbnb 
listings in various neighborhoods such as urban vs. rural or affluent vs. low-income. Additionally, this Kaggle 
dataset provides information about the price, minimum number of nights, amount of listings per host, and the number 
of days when listing is available, enabling us to perform detailed analyses.

Typical users: Users of our database will include a variety of people. First, some people are listing properties
on Airbnb and want to see what listings in their area have historically looked like, and what areas are more or 
less populated. 
They can explore which mix of factors seems to be the most successful. There are other stakeholders such as 
analysts or managers trying to figure out which properties are receiving the most bookings and generating the most revenue. 
Customers looking to book an Airbnb can use the database to explore the housing market to see where the most 
opportune place to travel based on past listings. 

Representative questions:  Some topics users will want answers to using our database include the following: Recent Orders: 
What are the most recent bookings or reservations made by Airbnb users overall?  What are the most recent bookings or 
reservations made by Airbnb users in each specific area of stay? Which properties were booked within that last 24 hours, 
overall as well as specific city of stay.

Most Popular Properties: What is the most frequently booked property in a specific city and time frame? What are the most 
frequent book properties overall? What types of properties are in high demand (house, condo, shared room), 
overall and by city, or state?

Available Accommodations: What properties are currently available for bookings during specific dates? How many vacant 
accommodations are available in a particular city or region? 

Revenue: Which geographical region has generated the highest revenue recently? Which are the top-performing locations? 
Can be based on booking cost or number of books. What is the most profitable season for each specific region (can be 
cities, states, or regions)?

Anticipated volume of reads, inserts, and updates: Queries per day: There could be hundreds of queries added to the dataset. 
This is flexible and changeable data based on the sales, examining, or reviews of the product of the company. 
The scale of increase could be substantial depending on the complexity of the data analysis performed. 

New Data added: The new information added could be significant due to the large number of data added across all 
cities and countries. Any new listing activities, reviews, or neighborhood status could influence new data being 
added to the dataset. This could range from thousands of pieces of information to be updated every day. 

Existing data change: The volume of existing data change could be relatively lower than the ones being added. 
The changes could be caused by false information input, user’s change in resident status, different feedback in reviews, 
and so on. The changes could be limited to several data per day in each data set. 

Where will performance matter: Performance of the queries is very important for each topic our users will explore. 
For recent orders, efficiency is crucial here as users will want real-time updates on recent bookings. 
This is essential for those who are planning to book that very moment. Regarding the most popular properties, 
this query may involve aggregating data and identifying booking patterns. The database needs to handle the data 
efficiently and effectively. The most important query for available accommodations is the availability of properties. 
The efficiency would be able to ensure users have up-to-date information on property availability for those who want
to make timely decisions. Lastly, for revenue, the highest-performing geographical region is the most important query. 
This query is essential for analyzing sales across different regions. Optimization of this query is important for 
providing accurate and timely insights on the best-performing regions.
